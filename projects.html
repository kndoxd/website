                 Converting Numbers in Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal (Assembly) <br> <br>
                  Description: This project involved an in-depth study of Assembly language,
                   focusing on the relations of registers and syntax.
                    I learned a significant amount about commands and the importance of being organized and focused while programming.
                     Following each line of code step-by-step taught me to backtrack and concentrate on my writing,
                      which is crucial in programming.

                    Basic Lejos Robot Movement <br> <br> 
                    Description: The objective of this project was to build a robot and write a complete script in Java to enable its functionality.
                     The robot was equipped with a sensor pole to detect walls, 
                     allowing it to move in all four directions and turn 90 degrees when it sensed an obstacle.
