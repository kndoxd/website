        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h3>My name is Abdullah Asaad Ladjal</h3>
        <p>I am from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. From a young age,
         I have been fascinated by Cyber Security and have always sought to explore its various aspects. 
         I am currently pursuing my studies in Cyber Security at Jeddah University,
          where I maintain a GPA of 4.5/5.</p>
        <p>I aspire to become a penetration tester or a security engineer,
             and I am currently enrolled in the eJPT course,
              aiming to earn the certification as soon as possible.
               I am passionate about discovering new and efficient ways to protect and secure data.</p>
        <p>I have a solid foundation in programming,
             particularly excelling in Python and Java,
              and I have experience with languages such as C, C++,
               and Assembly. Additionally,
                I am knowledgeable about the functioning of Kali Linux and can efficiently use its tools.</p>
        <p>In my free time, 
            I enjoy creating small programming projects and designing websites.</p>
